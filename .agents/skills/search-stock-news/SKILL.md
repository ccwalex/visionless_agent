# Yahoo Finance Stock News Search

## Purpose

Given a stock ticker symbol (e.g. `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `^GSPC`), return the latest news headlines listed on Yahoo Finance's per-ticker news tab. Each item carries title, article URL, publisher, relative age, content type (`story` / `video` / `press` / `ad`), and the tickers + percent changes annotated in the stream. Read-only — never follows article links, never submits forms beyond the search box, never interacts with sponsored content.

## When to Use

- "What's the latest on $TICKER?" / "Show me news for Apple."
- Periodic monitoring of headlines for a watchlist of tickers.
- Pre-trade sentiment lookup before a price decision is taken elsewhere.
- Anywhere you would otherwise hand-navigate Yahoo Finance's quote → news tab.

## Workflow

The fastest and most reliable path is a **direct deep-link to the per-ticker news page** — `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/{TICKER}/news/`. This skips the search box, the typeahead, and the `[title="News"]` click entirely. The UI-traversal path (search form #ybar-sf → quote page → click `[title="News"]`) works and is documented under *Browser fallback* below, but it costs ~3 extra turns and depends on the search-box typeahead intercepting Enter correctly (an undocumented behavior — see gotchas).

1. **Resolve the ticker.** Accept the ticker exactly as given. Yahoo's ticker space includes `.`-suffixed regional listings (`AAPL.B`), `^`-prefixed indices (`^GSPC`), `=X` currencies (`EURUSD=X`), `-USD` cryptos (`BTC-USD`), and `=F` futures (`CL=F`). Do NOT uppercase or normalize — pass through verbatim.

2. **Open the news page directly.**
   ```bash
   browse open "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/${TICKER}/news/" --remote --session "$SID"
   ```
   - **200 OK + News page** → proceed. Page title matches `^${TICKER_NAME} \(${TICKER}\) Latest Stock News.*Yahoo Finance$`.
   - **Redirect to `/lookup/?s=${TICKER}`** → ticker not found. The page renders "No results for '${TICKER}'" inside `.mainContent`. Emit `{ "success": false, "reason": "ticker_not_found", "ticker": "${TICKER}" }` and stop. Detect via `location.href.includes('/lookup/')` after navigation.

3. **Wait for the stream to render.** The headline list inside `.mainContent` is server-rendered for the first ~25 items, but story-tile metadata (publisher, age, related-ticker chips) fills in progressively. Wait 2–3 seconds after navigation, or until `document.querySelectorAll('.mainContent a[data-ylk*="elm:hdln"]').length >= 20`.

4. **(Optional) Filter to news-only.** The default `All` tab inside `.mainContent` includes sponsored slots (`ct:ad`) interleaved with stories. To filter to editorial news only, click the `[title="News"]` filter tab on the news page (it's an `<a class="tabBtn">` with `data-ylk` containing `subsec:news`). This is a *different* `[title="News"]` element from the one in the quote-nav (see gotchas). Alternative tabs: `[title="Earnings Calls"]`, `[title="Press Releases"]`, `[title="SEC Filings"]`. Skipping this step and filtering client-side by `ct === "story"` is equivalent and saves a click.

5. **Extract headlines from `.mainContent`.** Each story tile contains *two* anchors with the same href — one wrapping the thumbnail image (empty text), one wrapping the headline text. Dedupe by href, keep the text-bearing anchor:
   ```js
   const mc = document.querySelector('.mainContent');
   const headlines = Array.from(mc.querySelectorAll('a[data-ylk*="elm:hdln"]'));
   const seen = new Set();
   const items = [];
   for (const a of headlines) {
     if (seen.has(a.href) || !a.textContent.trim()) continue;
     seen.add(a.href);
     const dy = a.getAttribute('data-ylk') || '';
     const ct = (dy.match(/ct:(\w+)/) || [])[1] || null;          // story | video | ad
     const container = a.closest('section, li, article, div');
     const m = (container?.innerText || '').match(/\n([^\n]+)\n•\n([^\n]+)/);
     items.push({
       title: a.textContent.trim(),
       url: a.href,
       ct,
       publisher: m?.[1] || null,
       age: m?.[2] || null,
     });
   }
   ```
   The `data-ylk` attribute is Yahoo's per-element tracking payload; `elm:hdln` is the stable, site-wide marker for "this anchor is a headline link" and survives the various visual layouts (story tile, video tile, press release).

6. **(Optional) Paginate via scroll.** The page lazy-loads on scroll. Each `window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)` followed by a 2-second wait fetches the next ~20 headlines. Loop until the headline count stops growing or you hit a desired N. Verified iter-1: 25 → 45 after one scroll on AAPL.

7. **Skim the AI summary** (optional, top-of-stream). At the top of `.mainContent`, a "News headlines" block under heading text "Updated Xm ago · Powered by Yahoo Scout" contains a 2–3-sentence machine-generated synopsis of recent coverage. Useful as a one-line answer when the user asks for *a summary*, not a list. Text content can be read via `mc.querySelector('section[data-testid*="summary"], section:has(> div:contains("Yahoo Scout"))')?.innerText` — selector varies; safer is to grab the first non-nav text block in `.mainContent`.

### Browser fallback — via the user-requested UI flow

Use this path when the direct deep-link is blocked or when validating the searchbox flow itself.

1. Open `https://finance.yahoo.com/`.
2. Fill the search box inside `form#ybar-sf` — the input is `input#ybar-sbq` (name `p`):
   ```bash
   browse fill --remote --session "$SID" "#ybar-sbq" "${TICKER}"
   ```
3. Wait ~1 second for the typeahead `ul[role="listbox"]` to render. Confirm the top `li[role="option"]` text begins with `${TICKER}` followed by the company name and the tag `equity` / `etf` / `index`. If the top option does not match (e.g. user passed a partial / wrong ticker), abort.
4. Press Enter — the typeahead intercepts the form submission and navigates to `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/${TICKER}/`, **not** the form's stated action of `/lookup/`. This is undocumented behavior and is what makes the searchbox flow work as a ticker shortcut. (If you instead submit the form bypassing the typeahead — e.g. by POSTing to the action URL — you land on the lookup results page, which is wrong.)
   ```bash
   browse press --remote --session "$SID" Enter
   ```
5. On the quote page, locate `[title="News"]` — **there are two matches**: an `<a class="item yf-8g9x85" href=".../news/">` in the quote-nav bar (this is the one to click) and a `<button class="tabBtn l1 yf-zzox3x">` in some headers that is a non-navigating UI duplicate. Click the anchor specifically:
   ```bash
   browse eval --remote --session "$SID" 'document.querySelector("a[title=\"News\"]").click()'
   ```
6. Wait 2–3 seconds, then continue from step 3 of the optimal workflow above (extract from `.mainContent`).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Two `[title="News"]` elements coexist on the quote overview page.** The `<a class="item yf-8g9x85">` is the navigation link (goes to `/quote/${TICKER}/news/`). The `<button class="tabBtn l1 yf-zzox3x">` next to it is a visual duplicate that does *not* navigate. A naïve `document.querySelector('[title="News"]')` picks up the anchor first, which works — but `[title="News"]` is not a unique selector. Prefer `a[title="News"]` to be explicit. On the news page itself, `[title="News"]` is a third element — the *filter sub-tab* — which switches the stream from `All` to news-only.
- **Typeahead hijacks the search form's submit.** `form#ybar-sf` declares `action="https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup/"` and would normally GET `/lookup/?p=${TICKER}`. But when the typeahead `ul[role="listbox"]` is open and its top option is an equity match, pressing Enter triggers the typeahead's `option.click()` handler instead of the form submit, navigating to `/quote/${TICKER}/`. If the typeahead has not rendered yet (the box value was set without a synthetic input event, or you submitted within ~200ms of filling), Enter falls through to the form and you land on `/lookup/?p=${TICKER}` — a different page with no `.mainContent` news stream. Always wait for the listbox before pressing Enter, or click the first `li[role="option"]` explicitly.
- **Invalid ticker → silent redirect to `/lookup/?s=${TICKER}`.** Yahoo does *not* return 404 for unknown tickers on the `/quote/...` path. The URL silently rewrites to the lookup search results, which renders inside the same `.mainContent` container but with the text `Symbols similar to '${TICKER}' ... No results for '${TICKER}'`. Always check `location.href` after navigation; do not assume the request URL is the rendered URL.
- **Ticker casing and special characters matter.** `aapl` (lowercase) → 301 to uppercase URL, fine. `BRK.B` → works. `BRK-B` → silent rewrite to lookup. `^GSPC`, `=X`, `=F`, `-USD` suffixes are preserved verbatim by `/quote/`. URL-encode `^` as `%5E` for safety inside templated URLs.
- **`.mainContent` is shared across the entire `/quote/${TICKER}/*` route.** It contains the quote header, sticky price ticker, ad slots, *and* the news stream. Do NOT grab `mc.innerText` and treat it all as news — the first ~10 lines are nav tabs ("Summary | News | Research | Chart | …") and the price block. Scope queries to `mc a[data-ylk*="elm:hdln"]` instead.
- **Each story tile renders the same anchor twice (image + headline).** Without deduping by `href`, every headline appears as one empty-text entry plus one text entry. Dedupe by href and drop empty `textContent.trim()`.
- **`data-ylk` is the stable extraction surface, not CSS classes.** Yahoo ships utility classes like `yf-8g9x85`, `yf-ew9gqf`, `yf-zzox3x` that rotate with every redeploy. Stable hooks: `data-ylk*="elm:hdln"` (headline link), `data-ylk*="ct:story"` / `ct:video` / `ct:ad` (content type), `data-ylk*="elm:tab"` (filter tab), `data-testid="quote-nav-bar"` / `quote-sticky-hdr` / `quote-hdr`. Build selectors on these, not on the hashed class names.
- **Stream is lazy-loaded on scroll.** Initial render gives ~25 headlines; subsequent scrolls fetch ~20 more each. There is no "Load more" button — `window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)` is the only trigger. After ~5 scrolls the stream tapers off (~100 headlines is the practical ceiling per ticker).
- **Sponsored slots (`ct:ad`) are interleaved with editorial.** Filter them out client-side via `ct !== "ad"`, or click the `[title="News"]` sub-tab to get the editorial-only feed. Press releases live under `[title="Press Releases"]`, earnings transcripts under `[title="Earnings Calls"]`, and SEC filings under `[title="SEC Filings"]` (this last one is actually a dropdown, not a tab — `data-ylk` contains `elm:dropdown`).
- **No anti-bot wall observed.** Iter-1 ran with `--verified --proxies` and saw clean 200s end-to-end on `/`, `/quote/AAPL/`, `/quote/AAPL/news/`, `/quote/TSLA/news/`, `/lookup/?s=XYZNOTREAL`. No Akamai 403s, no GDPR consent banner (US IP), no rate-limit responses. Stealth is *not* required but was used as a safe default; a bare session is likely fine for low-volume use. Cookies: ~10 set on first load (Yahoo session, A1/A3 trackers); not required for content access.
- **`form#ybar-sf` is the unified Yahoo search box — same form/id on news.yahoo.com, sports.yahoo.com, etc.** On `finance.yahoo.com`, the typeahead is finance-scoped (equities, ETFs, indices, futures, currencies, crypto). On other Yahoo properties, the same form id produces a generic web/news typeahead, which will not route to a quote page. Always start from `finance.yahoo.com/`.
- **AI summary block ("Powered by Yahoo Scout") is opt-in machine output.** It appears above the headline list, paraphrases the top stories, and is regenerated every few minutes. Useful for `summary` mode but should never be quoted verbatim as if it were a primary source — emit it under a distinct field (`ai_summary`) and never confuse it with a headline.
